# colours are hard

## Categorical

Colour palettes usually include white/grey/black as their own hues. 
They are not counted in the titles below.

### < 8 colours

### 20 colours

It turns out 20 colours is a lot and is quite hard to auto-generate 
with a tool to any appreciably differentiative degree. So, I have 
no idea how perceptually dissimilar this is, but I tried my best 🤷‍

```python
colors = ['#F9337B', '#120D5A', '#FFC131', '#2BC1E2', '#580E33', 
          '#095400', '#EC7F40', '#38B9A3', '#f0bcc7', '#0286D2', 
          '#aaffc3', '#BD38A7', '#6F6F20', '#800000', '#e6beff', 
          '#896444', '#bfef45', '#cc3311', '#f4c99f', '#225555',
          '#CECECE', '#000000']
```
